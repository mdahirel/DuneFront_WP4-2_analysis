# Code for DuneFront project deliverable D4.2

The European project DuneFront (<https://dunefront.eu>, <https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101135410>) is working to improve coastal protection across Europe by using Nature-based Solutions (NbS), such as Dune-Dike hybrids (DD-hybrids), to defend coastlines from extreme weather and rising sea levels. Within this project, the “Biological boundary conditions” deliverable D4.2 focuses on understanding and mapping species distribution at kilometric scale for key dune species.

This repository contains the code and source data used to generate both the maps forming the main deliverable as well as other key outputs included in the deliverable report (both archived in Zenodo: **DOI pending**).  In addition to the notes in this repository, see the deliverable report for detailed information, use notes, and literature references.
